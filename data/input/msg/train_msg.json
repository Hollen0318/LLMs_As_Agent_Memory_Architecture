    "desc_user_0": "This is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: \n0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. \n1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).\n An example:\n[[- 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall - - - - -] \n [- 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 1Ball 1Door+ - - - - -] \n [- Yourself 0Empty 0Empty 1Key 5Wall - - - - -] \n [- 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 5Wall - - - - -] \n [- 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 5Wall - - - - -] \n [- 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall - - - - -]] \n The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.\nInterpretation can be:\na. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.\nb. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).\nc. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). \n 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. \n 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward \n Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.\n4. Gained experience:\nYou can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world. \n All these examples are just for your reference, your real observation will be provided to you later with a similar format.",
