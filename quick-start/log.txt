Your mission is to understand deeply about a text-based environment that's gonna be described by user and complete the mission for the environmentThis is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).
 An example:
[[- 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall - - - - -]

 [- 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 5Wall - - - - -] 
 [- 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall - - - - -]] 
 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:
You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world. 
 All these examples are just for your reference, your real observation will be provided to you later with a similar format.Got it! I'm ready to help you navigate and explore this 2D world. Please provide me with the initial world map and your current position (X, Y) and facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West, or Down/South) so that we can begin our adventure!Follow formats in previous examples, describe about it.

(0) left: turn your view to the left object
(1) right: turn your view to the right object
(2) toggle: toggle the object in front of you
(3) forward: move yourself to the front object if it's empty or opened
(4) pick up: pick up the front object

Use format like: I choose to do (a)  Action XX (b)  Action XX .... Choose one action or multiple actions is totally up to youselfI choose to do (3) forward and (0) left actions. 

Reason: By moving forward, I can explore the space in front of me and potentially discover new objects or areas. Additionally, by turning left, I can expand my field of view and gather more information about the surrounding objects and their properties. This combination of actions allows me to both move forward and gather more knowledge about the environment.Convert above reason of choices into a list of integers by calling function "choose_act" with the list of integers as parameterEnvironment view ratio = 45.455% Environment step ratio = 1.515% Environment memo ratio = 45.455% Object view ratio = 54.545%

0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).

 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:
You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world.

1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while.

Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward

What new findings you obtain from your actions?
Limit it to be less than 50 tokensFrom my actions, I have obtained the following new findings:
- I have moved forward and picked up a ball, which was previously in front of me.
- I have turned left and right, allowing me to gather more information about the objects in thoseCompare your new experience and previous experience, summarize them to help yourself continue explore the world as much as you can
Limit it to be less than 100 tokens.Comparing my new experience with my previous experience, I have confirmed the presence of grey walls surrounding the entire area. Moving forward, I discovered an empty space and a key to my right. Additionally, I picked up a ball that was in front of me. These observations provide me with potential opportunities to unlock the door and further explore the world. I will continue to strategize my actions based on these findings and aim to uncover more hidden objects and paths as I progress.Your mission is to understand deeply about a text-based environment that's gonna be described by user and complete the mission for the environmentThis is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while.

Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).

 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:

Limit it to be less than 100 tokens.Comparing my new experience with my previous experience, I have observed that exploring different directions has revealed both new empty spaces and walls. This suggests that there may be hidden paths and obstacles in the environment that I can uncover by continuing to navigate and explore. To further explore the world, I should consider trying different combinations of actions, such as toggling objects, picking up items, and dropping off inventory, to uncover more information and potentially find valuable objects or passages.Your mission is to understand deeply about a text-based environment that's gonna be described by user and complete the mission for the environmentThis is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).
 An example:
[[- 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall - - - - -]

 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:
You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world.

Limit it to be less than 50 tokensFrom my actions, I discovered a new empty space in front of me and successfully picked up an object, resulting in an empty inventory.Compare your new experience and previous experience, summarize them to help yourself continue explore the world as much as you can
Limit it to be less than 100 tokens.Comparing my new experience with my previous experience, I have learned that moving forward can lead to uncovering more empty spaces and potential objects. Toggling the object in front of me did not yield any significant changes. Additionally, picking up objects allows me to carry them in my inventory. Based on this, I should prioritize moving forward, be open to experimenting with different actions, and continue to explore and interact with the objects in the environment.Your mission is to understand deeply about a text-based environment that's gonna be described by user and complete the mission for the environmentThis is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).
 An example:

 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:
You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world.

Limit it to be less than 100 tokens.Comparing my new experience with my previous experience, I have learned that toggling objects can reveal hidden items, such as the key (1Key) that I found earlier. Moving forward has allowed me to uncover new empty spaces. Additionally, I have encountered a locked green door (1Door+), indicating the possibility of an unexplored area behind it. Based on this, I should continue exploring unexplored areas, interact with objects, and be open to discovering more objects and potential paths inYour mission is to understand deeply about a text-based environment that's gonna be described by user and complete the mission for the environmentThis is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).
 An example:

 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:
You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world.

Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while.

b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object.

Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object.

Gained experience Comparing my new experience with my previous experience, I have learned that there is a locked green door ahead, which confirms the importance of finding and using the key I discovered earlier. This suggests that there may be hidden areas or valuable items behind the locked door. To continue exploring the world, I need to prioritize finding a way to unlock the door and access the unexplored regions. Additionally, I should remain vigilant for any other locked doors or obstacles that may require specific actions or items to overcome.

This indicates that there may be more unexplored areas and potential objects to discover. Additionally, I have dropped off my inventory, allowing me to pick up new items if I come across them. To continue my exploration, I should prioritize moving forward and thoroughly investigate the surroundings for any clues, keys, or unlocked doors that may lead to further progress in this world.Your mission is to understand deeply about a text-based environment that's gonna be described by user and complete the mission for the environmentThis is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).

 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.

Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while.

This reveals a potential path for further exploration and indicates that there may be more unexplored areas in the vicinity.Compare your new experience and previous experience, summarize them to help yourself continue explore the world as much as you can
Limit it to be less than 100 tokens.Comparing my new experience with my previous experience, I have learned that toggling objects can reveal hidden paths and uncover new areas. By combining this action with moving forward, I can maximize my exploration and uncover potential paths or valuable items. I need to continue utilizing my past knowledge and be proactive in toggling objects to uncover the secrets of this world. Additionally, I should keep track of my surroundings and use my inventory wisely to overcome any obstacles that may arise.Your mission is to understand deeply about a text-based environment that's gonna be described by user and complete the mission for the environmentThis is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).

By combining this action with my previous knowledge of toggling objects and moving forward, I can systematically explore the world and uncover potential paths or valuable items. I should continue to use my past knowledge to navigate the world and be mindful of any new objects or obstacles that may hinder my progress.Your mission is to understand deeply about a text-based environment that's gonna be described by user and complete the mission for the environmentThis is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while.

By combining this action with moving forward and toggling objects, I can systematically explore the world and potentially find valuable items or hidden paths. I will continue to utilize my past knowledge and adapt my actions based on new observations to maximize my exploration of the environment.

1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while.

b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.

Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).

Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).

For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object.

Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).

For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:
You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world.

You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).
 An example:

 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:
You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world.

Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).

 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:

You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).
 An example:

 [- 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 5Wall - - - - -] 
 [- 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall - - - - -]] 
 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:
You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world.

The empty space (0Empty) in front of me continues to offer a potential path for further exploration. The key (1Key) remains in my inventory, indicating that I have successfully acquired it. Armed with this information, I can plan my next actions to continue exploring the world, potentially unlocking the locked objects and uncovering new discoveries.Your mission is to understand deeply about a text-based environment that's gonna be described by user and complete the mission for the environmentThis is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while.

Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward

2. Inventory: You are holding nothing 
3. Past actions: pick up, forward, forward, forward, left, forward, forward, toggle, forward 
What new findings you obtain from your actions?
Limit it to be less than 50 tokensFrom my forward action, I have discovered that the space in front of me is still empty (0Empty). This confirms that there are no obstacles blocking my path, allowing me to continue exploring further.Compare your new experience and previous experience, summarize them to help yourself continue explore the world as much as you can
Limit it to be less than 100 tokens.Comparing my new experience with my previous experience, I have confirmed that my position remains unchanged at (4, 1) facing Down/South. The empty space (0Empty) in front of me continues to offer a potential path for further exploration. The key (1Key) remains in my inventory, indicating that I have successfully acquired it. Armed with this information, I can plan my next actions to continue exploring the world, potentially unlocking locked objects and uncovering new discoveries.Your mission is to understand deeply about a text-based environment that's gonna be described by user and complete the mission for the environmentThis is a text-based small 2D world, you mission is to explore it as much as you can, understand surrounding's object's properties and summarize useful experience. Observations are composed of: 
0. World ID, your position and your facing direction. 
1. World Map: A 2D matrix that records yourself and surrounding objects, where each object is encoded by this rule: If 5 is grey, then 5Wall is grey wall. 1 is green, 1Door+ will mean a green door but locked because + represents locked. Yourself is the position of you in the world map, with coordinate being (X, Y) and your facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West or Down/South). You cannot see objects behind you or blocked behind. The world map will be updated as you explore around. You will forget about positions that you haven't explored for a while. Places you have forgotten or have not viewed yet will all be marked as unseen (-).
 An example:
[[- 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall - - - - -] 
 [- 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 1Ball 1Door+ - - - - -] 
 [- Yourself 0Empty 0Empty 1Key 5Wall - - - - -] 
 [- 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 5Wall - - - - -] 
 [- 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 5Wall - - - - -] 
 [- 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall 5Wall - - - - -]] 
 The numbers represents color, where black is 0, green is 1, blue is 2, purple is 3, yellow is 4 and grey is 5. Symbols represent status, nothing is open, + is locked, * is closed. For example 5Door* is a green closed door. Your position (X, Y) and facing direction. For example in this world map your position is (2,1) and direction is East/Right.
Interpretation can be:
a. You are in a room with walls that are grey (5Wall) on the top, bottom, and right side.
b. Three spaces in front of you, to your left/west, is a green ball (1Ball).
c. Four spaces in front of you, one space to your left, is a green locked (+) door (1Door+). 
 2. Inventory. You can only hold one item with you. For example you are holding a key, then you can't pick up anything unless you dropped off your key to an droppable object. 
 3. Past actions. You can remember your latest few past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. An example:  Your past actions are forward, forward 
 Interpretation: You have tried forward two times.
4. Gained experience:
You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world. 
 All these examples are just for your reference, your real observation will be provided to you later with a similar format.Got it! I'm ready to help you navigate and explore this 2D world. Please provide me with the initial world map and your current position (X, Y) and facing direction (Right/East, Up/North, Left/West, or Down/South) so that we can begin our adventure!Follow formats in previous examples, describe about it.

5Wall 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty 0Empty -Choose an action or a mutiple step actions plan from the following to exlore the environment as much as you can: 
(0) left: turn your view to the left object
(1) right: turn your view to the right object
(2) toggle: toggle the object in front of you
(3) forward: move yourself to the front object if it's empty or opened
(4) pick up: pick up the front object
(5) drop off: drop off your current inventory
