The environment ID, your position (X, Y) and your facing direction (right, up, left or down).\n\n1. World Map\n\n    The world map consists of three channels, object, color, and status, all of them are of shape ({}, {}), with values being corresponding object, color, or status.\n\n    Though you can only see a portion of the world map every time, you will remember & update the world map when you are exploring around. \n\n    During the exploration, you will also start to forget about the world map that you haven't explored for a little while.\n\n    You can only see areas in front of you, so the area not in your sight will gradually be forgotten.\n\n   Places you have forgotten or have not viewed them yet will be marked as unseen (-).\n\n    Example:\n\n    1.1 Object Map\n\n    The numbers in the object map correspond to: (unseen: -, empty: 1, wall: 2, floor: 3, door: 4, key: 5, ball: 6, box: 7, goal: 8, lava: 9, Position and facing direction: Right, Left, Up, Down)\n        \n    [[- 2 2 2 2 2 - - - - -]\n     [- 1 1 1 6 4 - - - - -]\n     [- Right 1 1 5 2 - - - - -]\n     [- 1 1 1 1 2 - - - - -]\n     [- 1 1 1 1 2 - - - - -]\n     [- 2 2 2 2 2 - - - - -]]\n\n    Interpretation: \n    You are standing at (2,1) facing Right, you can see there is a wide region in front with each object numbered. \n    For example, a key (5) is two steps in front of you. A ball (6) is blocking you from the door (4). \n    A wall is surrounding you, a ball, door, and key. The objects behind you, or the door as well as the wall are unseen (0). \n\n    1.2 Color Map\n\n    The numbers in the color map correspond to: (unseen: -, black: 0, green: 1, blue: 2, purple: 3, yellow: 4, grey: 5, Position and facing direction: Right, Left, Up, Down)\n\n    [[- 5 5 5 5 5 - - - - -]\n     [- 0 0 0 1 1 - - - - -]\n     [- Right 0 0 1 5 - - - - -]\n     [- 0 0 0 0 5 - - - - -]\n     [- 0 0 0 0 5 - - - - -]\n     [- 5 5 5 5 5 - - - - -]]\n\n    Interpretation: \n    You are standing at (2,1) facing Right, you can see there are three green objects in the Color Map, combined with the object map you know they are a green ball, key, and door (1).\n    The wall is all of color grey (5) and empty spaces are all of color black (0). The objects behind you, the door, and the wall are unseen (-).  \n\n    1.3. Status Map\n\n    The numbers in the status map correspond to (unseen: -, open: 0, closed: 1, locked: 2, Position and facing direction: Right, Left, Up, Down)\n\n    [[- 0 0 0 0 0 - - - - -]\n     [- 0 0 0 0 2 - - - - -]\n     [- Right 0 0 0 0 - - - - -]\n     [- 0 0 0 0 0 - - - - -]\n     [- 0 0 0 0 0 - - - - -]\n     [- 0 0 0 0 0 - - - - -]]\n\n    Interpretation: \n    You are standing at (2,1) facing Right, and you can see there is a locked object, combined with the previous observations, you can tell that is a locked green door.\n\n2. Inventory\n\n    You can only hold one item with you. \n\n    Example:\n\n    You are holding nothing.\n\n    Interpretation:\n    If you are not holding anything, you can \"pick up\" an object, otherwise, you must \"drop off\" to an empty space to pick up something else.\n\n3. Past actions:\n\n    You can remember your latest {} past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. \n\n    An example:\n    Your past actions are forward, forward\n\n    Interpretation:\n    You have tried forward two times.\n\n4. Gained experience:\n\n    You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world. \n\n    An example:\n    a. I observed a ball (6) and a key (5) in front of me.\n    b. The wall (5) is blocking me so I need to turn around.\n \n    Interpretation:\n    You have the above experience to guide yourself to explore the world as much as you can.\n\nRemember all these examples are just for your reference, your real observation will be provided to you later with a similar format.\nRemember during exploration you will forget past scenes so get stuck at the corner will lose past memory about the world map.\nRemember you can only interact with the single object right in front of you with actions being \"toggle\", \"drop off\", and \"pick up\". \nWhat object you can \"toggle\", \"pick up\" and \"drop off\" is going to be learned from your exploration. \nYour inventory status also affects how you can interact with objects.\nPay attention to your world map observation as it includes your position, direction and environment layout.",
