Your mission is to call the function "choose_act" to explore a small 2D world as much as you can.
Observations will be composed of following items:

1. World Map

    The world map consist of three channel, object, color and status, each of which is of shape shape, with values being corresponding object, color or status.

    Though you can only see a portion of world map every time, but you will remember & update the world map when you are exploring around. 

    During the exploration, you will also start to forget about the world map that you haven't explored for a little while.

    Example:

    1.1 Object Map

    The numbers in the object map correspond to: {unseen: 0, empty: 1, wall: 2, floor: 3, door: 4, key: 5, ball: 6, box: 7, goal: 8, lava: 9, Yourself: →, ←, ↑, ↓}
        
    [[0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 1 1 1 6 4 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 → 1 1 5 2 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 1 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 1 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0]]

    Interpretation: 
    You are standing at (2,1) facing east (→), you can see there a wide region in front with each object numbered. 
    For example, a key (5) is two steps in front of you. A ball (6) is blocking you from the door (4). 
    A wall is surrounding you, ball, door and key. The objects behind you, or the door as well as wall are unseen (0). 

    1.2 Color Map

    The numbers in the color map correspond to: {unseen: -, black: 0, green: 1, blue: 2, purple: 3, yellow: 4, grey: 5, Yourself: →, ←, ↑, ↓}

    [[- 5 5 5 5 5 - - - - -]
     [- 0 0 0 1 1 - - - - -]
     [- → 0 0 1 5 - - - - -]
     [- 0 0 0 0 5 - - - - -]
     [- 0 0 0 0 5 - - - - -]
     [- 5 5 5 5 5 - - - - -]]

    Interpretation: 
    You are standing at (2,1) facing east (→), you can see there are three green objects in the Color Map, combined with the object map you know they are green ball, key and door (1).
    The wall are all of color grey (5) and empty spaces are all of color black (0). The objects behind yourself, door and wall are unseen (-).  

    1.3. Status Map

    The numbers in the status map correspond to: {unseen: -, open: 0, closed: 1, locked: 2, Yourself: →, ←, ↑, ↓}

    [[- 0 0 0 0 0 - - - - -]
     [- 0 0 0 0 2 - - - - -]
     [- → 0 0 0 0 - - - - -]
     [- 0 0 0 0 0 - - - - -]
     [- 0 0 0 0 0 - - - - -]
     [- 0 0 0 0 0 - - - - -]]

    Interpretation: 
    You are standing at (2,1) facing east (→), you can see there is locked object, combined with the previous observations, you can tell that is a locked green door.

2. Inventory

    You can only hold one item with you. 

    Example:

    You are holding nothing.

    Interpretation:
    If you are not holding anything, you can pick up object by calling "choose_act" with parameter being "pick up", otherwise, you must use call with "drop off" to a empty space in order to pick up something else.
3. Past actions:

    You can remember your latest {} past actions, try using diverse actions as they help to explore the world. 

    An example:
    Your past actions are forward, forward

    Interpretation:
    You have tried forward two times.

4. Gained experience:

    You can refer to your gained past experiences to guide you to explore the world. 

    An example:
    a. I have observed a ball (6) and a key (5) in front of me.
 
    Interpretation:
    You have the above experience to guide yourself to explore the world as much as you can.

Remember all these examples are just for your references, your real observation will be provided to you later with similar format
